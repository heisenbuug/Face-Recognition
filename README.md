### Introduction

Image recognition, in the context of machine vision, is the ability of software to identify objects, places, people, writing and actions in images. Computers can use machine vision technologies in combination with a camera and artificial intelligence software to achieve image recognition.
Image recognition has very wide range of applications, some examples are: 
* Powering self-driving cars
* Boosting augmented reality applications and gaming
* Teaching machines to see
* Image Classification for Websites with Large Visual Databases
* Image Search
